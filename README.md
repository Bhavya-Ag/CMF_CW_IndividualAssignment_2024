## Project Overview
This repository contains my individual project for the Computational Methods for Finance module. The project demonstrates the application of Python in financial analysis, focusing on the use of key libraries and implementation of financial models.

## Repository Contents
- `Example_using_Libraries.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and yfinance usage by analysing Apple stock
- `HistoricalData_yfinance.ipynb`: Script for downloading historical stock data
- `HSBC_AstraZeneca_2years_data.csv`: CSV file containing 2-year historical data for selected FTSE 100 stocks

## Project Objectives
1. Explain and demonstrate the use of Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance
2. Perform data handling and analysis on selected FTSE 100 equities
3. Discuss and analyze the Black-Scholes option pricing model
4. Apply computational finance techniques to real-world financial data

## Project Structure
1. **Python Fundamentals**
   - Explanation of Python libraries, modules, and packages
